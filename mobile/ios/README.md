## Sideload IPA

GitHub Actions builds `Vitr-0.1.0-sideload.ipa` using the standard iOS `Payload/Vitr.app` layout with no embedded Apple provisioning profile or stale code signature. It is intended for sideload tools that re-sign the app for the target device, such as AltStore/SideStore/Sideloadly-style workflows.

A directly installable App Store/TestFlight IPA still requires a real Apple-issued signing certificate and provisioning profile; the build does not fake an Apple signing identity.
